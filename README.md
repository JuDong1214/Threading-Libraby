# C++ ThreadingLibrary

## The code for this repo is private due to a confidentiality agreement

Created a robust threading library that enables the implementation of multi-threaded applications in C++.

Implemented core components, including CPU scheduling algorithms, thread management, mutexes, and conditional
variables, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

Integrated timer and inter-processor interrupts to facilitate precise time-based thread scheduling and to support efficient
parallel execution of threads across multiple CPUs.

Conducted comprehensive testing, creating an extensive suite of test cases to thoroughly validate the libraryâ€™s
functionality and identify and resolve any errors or bugs.
